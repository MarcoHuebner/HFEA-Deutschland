    "Already in January 1973 the stock market started to fade away. In the same time the inflation was increasing drastically from 3% to 7%. In October 1973, the Yom Kippur War started and as reaction to this war OPEC was reducing the Oil production. We can see a first big drop by 16% in the stock market until December, followed by a sideway period. In March 1974, so around 3-4 month after the drop, it seems that a recovery will come, but then the stock market dropped again up to 35% from the value of March 1974. In sum the stock market was dropping 44%. During this time the inflation was reaching a value of up to 12%. \n",
    "\n",
    "When inflation started to decrease, the stock market also started to recover strongly. But it still was sensitive to small increases of inflation as we can see in Jul. 1975. It tool 42 month, until the stock market reached the level before the crysis started. But afterwards it was still trapped in years long sideway trend until late 1978/1979. Interestingly the second oil crysis in 1987 seems not to have a big effect at all. \n",
    "\n",
    "The interest rate was also increased from beginning of 1973 until Sep. 1973. Then the rate was reduced, just to increase it strongly from beginning 1974 to mid of 1974. After mid of 1974 the interest rate was falling until 1977 and then slightly increaed again. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can clearly see, that the LTT price is are often inverse to the interest rate. If the interest rate growth strongly the LTT in declining. If the interest rate in dropping, the LTTs are growing. Very interesting is the time from 1977, where the interest rate is starting to increase again, but very slowly. At this time the LTTs are just moving sideways and are not dropping much. However they start to drop mid of 1979, when the interest rate was increased much in very short time. \n",
    "\n",
    "So here we can conclude: That a moderate increase of interest rate is not directly harming LTTs. But a strong and therefore maybe unexpected increase lets the LTTs drop. Nevertheless, you need to take into account, that LTTs were callable at this time. So it could be that they are now much less sensitive to interest rate then at the 1970th. \n",
