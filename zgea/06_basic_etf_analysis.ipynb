This decay cames from the fact, that if an asset is on the one day loosing 1% and on the other day gaining 1%, the total value is still less on the second day. Thus every kind of investment has this decay. However, due to the leverage factor the decay is stronger for leveraged ETFs, thus they suffer stronger from it.\n",

The first time period is from 1943 until 1986. The second from 1986 to 2021. We chose this separation, because `Hedgefundie` has done his/ her original backtests from 1986 to 2018.
