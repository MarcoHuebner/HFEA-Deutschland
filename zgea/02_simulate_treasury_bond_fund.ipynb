    "\n",
    "The HFEA strategy is based on treasury bond funds as hedge for the growth part of the portfolio. Thus, it is important to have the value of all interesting treasury bond funds available for many years. Ideally even before 1970, where the oil crises started. However, all treasury bond funds, just exist since some years. So the oldest fund was available around 2010. Therefore, we have to simulate such a fond to do a long term backtest with this kind of hedge.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the [bogleheads thread](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=179425) the user `longinvest` explains how a treasury bond fund could be simulated. In this notebook we try out different approaches, compare them with each other and calculate the simulated treasury bond fund values on daily base beginning of 1943."

    "In the thread \"Historical Bond Returns - From Rates to Returns [Bond Fund Simulator]\" from user `longinvest` of the [bogleheads forum](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=179425), the user describes three different approaches how to simulate a bond fund.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first approach is based on the idea, that the bond fund buys every year a single 10 years bond. On the next year the fund collects the coupon (yield) and sells the bond. For calculating the remaining price of the bond, the function \"present value\" (PV in excel) is used. This calculation introduced two errors: First of all, for calculating the present value of the bond, we would need the 9 years bond yield, which is not available for us. Thus we have to use the 10 years bond yield, which tends to lead to lower values. The second issue is, that this is not the way a real bond fund works. Thus the characteristics of the simulates bond fund is different to the reality. But it is still a nice starting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement this, we create a class, which models a single bond. It has a method to calculate the current value of the bond, based on the currend date (remaining time to maturity) and the current bond interest rate for such type of bond. It also has a method to collect the gains of this bond, since the last call. Thus we can also collect partly coupons (within a year).\n",
    "\n",
    "It also provides two convenience methods, for calculating the ramining years until the bond matures and to interpolate between two bond interest rates. Those methods are needed later for the more complex approaches. "
